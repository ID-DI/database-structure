Challenge 10 - MySQL
For this challenge:
For this challenge you need to create a database structure for an online store.
The store offers several services including:
• Food products
• Drinks (alcoholic, non-alcoholic, carbonated, non-carbonated)
• Tobacco (cigarettes per piece, box and dry tobacco)
• Milk and dairy products
• Confectionery products
• Cosmetics
• Household items
For each product you need to store its name, date of manufacture, shelf life,
composition, storage temperature, place of origin, manufacturer and
importer if any.
For tobacco products you need to store information about the amount of
nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide they have.
Alcoholic products have a certain strength expressed in percentages, and
household items are divided into cleaning agents and kitchen utensils.
You need to have several types of users:
1. Administrators who modify, add and delete products
2. Buyers who fill their own baskets and demand delivery for them
3. Suppliers, who review orders and provide delivery time

by the buyer, what time it was approved by the administrator, which
administrator approved it, which supplier took it, and when it was delivered to
the customer, which is also entered by the supplier, and by the buyer.
When receiving the order, the buyer has the option to leave a review / remark
about it, by giving a rating of 1-5, adding a comment of a few sentences and
confirming the time of arrival of the order.
After leaving the order, the supplier marks it as delivered with the delivery
time, gives a rating to the buyer of 1-5 and can leave an additional comment.
